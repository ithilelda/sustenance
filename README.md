# Sustenance
A small mod expanding the saturation/food system. Only required on the server. Installing it on the client allows single player worlds to be in effect.

## Current Features:
- saturation has no limit at all.
- Regeneration interval, threshold, and amount can be configured.

## Future plans:
- adding attributes to modify health regeneration capabilities from food.
